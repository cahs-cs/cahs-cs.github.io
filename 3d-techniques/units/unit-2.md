# Unit 2

Intro to 3D Design w/ TinkerCAD

Students will focus on creating 3D objects in TinkerCAD and exporting them for various purposes. We will look at 3D printing objects, as well as exporting graphics for our portfolios.

## Learning Outcomes

### New Concepts

- 2.9.2. Determine the scope and purpose of the project.
- 2.9.4. Develop a conceptual model and design brief for the project.
- 2.9.5. Develop a timeline, a communication plan, a task breakdown, costs (e.g., equipment, labor), deliverables, and responsibilities for completion.
- 2.11.1. Identify the problem.
- 2.11.2. Select troubleshooting methodology (e.g., top down, bottom up, follow the path, spot the differences).
- 2.11.3. Investigate symptoms based on the selected methodology.
- 2.11.7. Implement a solution.
- 7.3.3. Incorporate graphics (e.g., digital, hand-drawn, photographic).
- 7.3.4. Incorporate computer animation.
- 7.3.10. Produce, test, debug, and archive a final product.
- 7.4.1. Identify the purpose and intended audience of graphics
- 7.4.2. Select color, shape, size, and texture of objects.
- 7.4.3. Create or acquire graphics.
- 7.4.6. Select an appropriate graphic file format and resolution.
- 7.4.7. Optimize and export graphics files for intended use.
- 7.4.8. Select graphic software applications.
- 7.4.9. Manipulate graphic objects.
- 7.4.11. Describe and select color profiles (e.g., Red Green Blue [RGB], Cyan Magenta Yellow Key [CMYK], Pantone).
- 7.6.2. Import 2D, 3D, and virtual assets.
- 7.6.5. Create 2D, 3D, and virtual environments.
- 7.6.6. Render and export animations.

### Review

- 2.7.2. Describe ways to present data (e.g., responsive web design, mobile applications, desktop applications, web applications).
- 2.7.6. Describe the characteristics and use of browser plug-ins.
- 7.1.1. Identify the types and uses of interactive media environments (e.g., web-based, kiosks, games, mobile devices, video, print).
