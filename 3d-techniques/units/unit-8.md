# Unit 8

Final Project

Students will create a final project in Fusion 360, TinkerCAD, Blender, or Alice 3. This project will be added to the students portfolio by the end of the course. This project will function as their final exam grade.

Students will spend time focusing on their portfolio and making sure it works and displays their work well.

Student portfolios will function as their final exam grade.
