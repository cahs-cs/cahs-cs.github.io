# Books

## Coursework

The following books are either used in class, or would be useful for students to learn from.

- "Blue Pelican Java" by Charles Emerson Cook
- "The Nature of Code" by Daniel Shiffman

## Teaching Philosophy

The following are books I have read that I feel strongly influence or represent my own teaching philosophy. These are not necessarily related to computer science, however they have all made me into a better teacher.

- "Pedagogy of the Oppressed" by Paulo Friere
- "Grading for Equity" by Joe Feldman
- "Guide to Teaching Computer Science" by Orit Hazzan, Tami Lapidot, Noa Ragonis
