# Introduction

Welcome to my classroom (or at least a digital version of it). I will be updating this website throughout the year as I develop my curriculum, and hopefully in future years as I continue to build out this program.

I am a big fan of open source development, and I believe curriculum should be similar. I hope that by developing curriculum in the open students, parents, or even other teachers can see how I teach and even contribute in some cases.

Please feel free to explore the different courses to learn more! However, this site is pretty bare at the moment. 2022-2023 will be my first year as a full time teacher!
